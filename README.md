# Heat-Plate-Calculator

Second HW

Calculates the average temperature of various heat plates

Data is derived from two given algorithms:                                                   
T(x,y)=100+100sin(πxL)sinh(πyL)sinh(πHL)                                      
Tavg=∑999i=0∑999j=0T(iL999,jH999)1000×1000                                         

NOTE: All projects were compiled and tested using g++, they may not with visual studio.
